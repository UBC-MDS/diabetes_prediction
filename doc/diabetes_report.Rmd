# Summary 

To answer to the study question which is "Given a person's health indicators, can we know if he/she has diabete or not?", we have split the data into test and train and perfomed a transformation only on numeric features.
We have thereafter attempted to build different classification models using Dummy Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Neighbors Classifier, SVC  and Logistic Regression.  After looking  at cross-validations from the different models, the SVM and the Logistic Regression models had high recall and f1 scores. The two models were tuned and used on the test data. The f1 score for the tuned SVC was `r test_results[[2,3]]` as opposed to `r test_results[[2,6]]` for the tuned logistic regression. When it comes to the recall scores, the SVC performed `r test_results[[2,4]]` as opposed to `r test_results[[2,4]]` for the logistic regression. The two models are spotting a high proportion of actual positives which is in our case people with diabete.
