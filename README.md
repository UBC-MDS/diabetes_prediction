Authors:  Flora Ouedraogo , Austin Shih , Roan Raina, Mehdi Naji

## Goal: This project aims to build a model which will be able to predict if a patient has diabete or not given some information about his/her health indicators.

## Introduction

Diabete is a disease which affects many people around the world. This disease is the result of the lack of insulin in the body. Insulin is a hormone produced by your pancreas whose role is to regulate the amount of glucose in the blood. Blood sugar must be carefully regulated to ensure that the body functions properly. Too much blood sugar can damage some organs, like blood vessels and nerves. Our body also needs insulin in order to use sugar for energy. According to the International Diabetes Federation “In 2021, Approximately 537 million adults (20-79 years) are living with diabetes. The total number of people living with diabetes is projected to rise to 643 million by 2030 and 783 million by 2045”.
With these alarming figures, many experts claim that it is important to have a good  lifestyle, i.g. physical activity and good eating habits, in order to avoid this disease or avoid its complicated form. Can we really tell if a person is suffering from diabetes or not, given some health information about the person's lifestyle?
