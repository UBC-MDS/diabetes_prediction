## Fixing Typos
Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.

## Bug Fixes
Look through the GitHub issues for tags with "bug" and "help wanted". Follow the below `Pull Request Process` to implement fixes.

## Prerequisites
Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem. If you've found a
bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

## Pull Request Process
* Create a branch for each pull request (PR)
* New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org) or PEP8 [style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
